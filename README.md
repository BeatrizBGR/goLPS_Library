# goLPS_Library
This is a library of globally-optimized local pseudopotentials (goLPSs) as developed in the group of Professor Emily A Carter at Princeton University ( https://carter.princeton.edu ).

## Structure
Our goLPSs are generated using the LDA exchange-correlation functional (Perdew-Zunger-Ceperley-Alder) and the GGA exchange-correlation functional (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) with no spin-polarization. They also depend on the kinetic energy density functional used for their construction.
